# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Strands Agent deployed on Amazon Bedrock that automatically analyzes programming code files stored in S3 and generates comprehensive design specifications. The agent processes code files from an input S3 bucket, leverages Bedrock models to analyze the code structure and functionality, and outputs detailed design specifications to a destination S3 bucket.

## Glossary

- **Code Analysis Agent**: The Strands Agent system that processes programming code files and generates design specifications
- **Input S3 Bucket**: The Amazon S3 bucket containing programming code files to be analyzed
- **Destination S3 Bucket**: The Amazon S3 bucket where generated design specifications are stored
- **Bedrock Model**: The Amazon Bedrock foundation model used for code analysis and specification generation
- **Design Specification**: A structured document detailing what the code does, its architecture, and functionality
- **Prompt Template**: A predefined template used to structure requests to the Bedrock model for consistent analysis

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to automatically process code files from S3, so that I can get design specifications without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code file reference is provided to the Code Analysis Agent, THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL retrieve the file from the Input S3 Bucket
2. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL validate that the retrieved file contains programming code
3. IF the file cannot be retrieved from the Input S3 Bucket, THEN THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL log an error and terminate processing
4. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL support common programming file formats including .py, .js, .java, .cpp, .cs, .go, .rb, .php, and .ts
5. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL handle files up to 1MB in size

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to use Bedrock models for code analysis, so that I can leverage advanced AI capabilities for understanding complex code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL integrate with Amazon Bedrock service for model invocation
2. WHEN processing a code file, THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL pass the file contents to the Bedrock Model using the Prompt Template
3. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL use a configurable Bedrock Model (defaulting to Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
4. IF the Bedrock Model invocation fails, THEN THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
5. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL handle Bedrock service limits and throttling gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to generate structured design specifications, so that I can understand what the code does and how it's architected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL use a Prompt Template that requests structured analysis of the code
2. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL generate Design Specifications that include code purpose, main functions, data structures, dependencies, and architectural patterns
3. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL format the Design Specification as a markdown document
4. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL include the original file name and analysis timestamp in the Design Specification
5. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL ensure the Design Specification is comprehensive and readable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated design specifications stored in S3, so that I can access and share them easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Bedrock Model returns a Design Specification, THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL write the specification to a file
2. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL store the Design Specification file in the Destination S3 Bucket
3. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL name the output file using the pattern: `{original_filename}_design_spec_{timestamp}.md`
4. IF the write to Destination S3 Bucket fails, THEN THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL retry up to 3 times
5. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL set appropriate metadata on the S3 object including content type and custom tags

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to be properly deployed on Bedrock, so that it can be invoked reliably and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL be deployed as a Bedrock Agent with proper IAM permissions
2. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL have read permissions for the Input S3 Bucket
3. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL have write permissions for the Destination S3 Bucket
4. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL have invoke permissions for the specified Bedrock Model
5. THE Code Analysis Agent SHALL implement proper error handling and logging for all operations
